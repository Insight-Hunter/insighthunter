## ⚡ Why Insight Hunter Runs on Cloudflare Edge

Insight Hunter is deployed entirely on Cloudflare's global edge network —
not a traditional server, not a cloud region. Here's what that means for you.

### Zero Cold Starts. Zero Data Centers to Manage.

Cloudflare operates in **330+ cities across 125+ countries**, directly
connected to over 13,000 networks — including every major ISP on earth.
When a request hits Insight Hunter, it's handled by the data center
physically closest to that user. There is no "us-east-1." There is no
single point of failure.

### What Powers Insight Hunter

| Service              | What It Does                                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Workers**          | Runs the entire API — serverless, globally distributed|
| **D1**               | SQLite database replicated to the edge                |
| **KV**               | Sub-millisecond session and config storage            |
| **R2**               | Zero-egress object storage for documents + exports    |
| **Queues**           | Async job processing (email, payroll, exports)        |
| **Workers AI**       | On-network LLM inference — no external API calls      |
| **Vectorize**        | Vector database for semantic search (Scout)           |
| **Durable Objects**  | Stateful coordination for PBX WebSockets + AI chat    |
| **Analytics Engine** | Real-time event tracking, sub-second queries          |

### What This Means for Small Businesses

Traditional SaaS stacks charge you indirectly for the infrastructure:
the VMs, the load balancers, the database clusters, the CDN subscriptions.
Cloudflare's edge model eliminates all of that. Insight Hunter passes those
savings directly to pricing — without compromising on uptime, latency, or
security.

> **48%** of the world's top 1,000 networks are fastest through Cloudflare.
> Your users — wherever they are — get enterprise response times.

## What Is Insight Hunter?

Insight Hunter is an AI-powered financial operations platform built specifically for small businesses, freelancers, and fractional CFOs. It replaces the patchwork of QuickBooks, spreadsheets, a payroll service, a phone system, and an expensive CPA with a single, affordable tool that runs intelligently in the background.

It does not just store numbers. It tells you what the numbers mean, what to do about them, and what is coming next.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Most small business owners manage their finances reactively — looking at last month's numbers to make today's decisions. The tools available either cost too much (enterprise software), do too little (basic bookkeeping apps), or require a human expert to interpret (accountants and CFOs at $200–$400/hour).

The result: missed opportunities, cash flow surprises, compliance deadlines ignored, and no strategic visibility into the business they are building.

Insight Hunter changes that equation.

```

The Worker serves both the static frontend (`public/`) and the full REST API (`/api/*`) from the same deployment. The frontend uses relative fetch calls — no CORS, no separate domain, no API keys in the browser.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A free [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Insight-Hunter/insighthunter.git
cd insighthunter
npm install
```

### 2. Authenticate with Cloudflare

```bash
# Option A — browser login (local machine)
wrangler login

# Option B — API token (cloud IDE, CI/CD)
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
# Get token: dash.cloudflare.com → My Profile → API Tokens → Edit Cloudflare Workers
```

### 3. Create Cloud Resources (run once)

```bash
bash bootstrap.sh
```

This creates your D1 database, KV namespaces, R2 buckets, Queues, and Vectorize index. Copy the printed IDs into `wrangler.toml`.

### 4. Set Secrets

```bash
wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
wrangler secret put TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID   # for PBX
wrangler secret put TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN    # for PBX
```

### 5. Run Migrations

```bash
bash migrate.sh local       # test locally
bash migrate.sh production  # apply to Cloudflare D1
```

### 6. Local Development

```bash
wrangler dev --local --persist
# → http://localhost:8787
```

### 7. Deploy to Production

```bash
wrangler deploy
# → https://insighthunter.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

## Connecting Frontend to Backend

All HTML pages in `public/` connect to the backend via the shared `api.js` client using **relative URLs** — no hardcoded domain, no CORS required.

```html
<!-- Add to every dashboard HTML page -->
<script src="/js/api.js"></script>
<script src="/auth/guard.js"></script>
```

```js
// Anywhere in your page scripts
const summary = await api.summary('2026-01-01', '2026-03-31')
const insight = await api.quickInsight()
const txns    = await api.transactions({ limit: '25', type: 'expense' })
```

All API calls automatically:
- Send session cookies (`credentials: 'include'`)
- Redirect to `/auth/login.html` on 401
- Return parsed JSON or throw a typed error

---

## Environment Variables

Set in `wrangler.toml` (non-sensitive) or via `wrangler secret put` (sensitive):

| Variable | Where | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret | Signs and verifies session tokens |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `wrangler.toml` | CORS origin whitelist |
| `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` | `wrangler.toml` | Session expiry (default: 86400) |
| `AI_MODEL` | `wrangler.toml` | Workers AI model for chat |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Secret | PBX — Twilio account |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Secret | PBX — Twilio auth |
| `TWILIO_SIGNING_KEY` | Secret | PBX — webhook signature validation |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Secret | Payment processing (Pro upgrades) |

---

## CI/CD

Automatic deployment on push to `main` via GitHub Actions.

Add one secret to your GitHub repo:

```
GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions
Name:  CF_API_TOKEN
Value: (Cloudflare API token with Workers + Pages edit permissions)
```

The workflow deploys the Worker automatically on every push to `main`.
